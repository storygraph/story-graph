# :jack_o_lantern: :lollipop: Story Graph
Story graph is a state-control system for storytellers. It models a story as a set of **storylines with states at every given moment.**. Each state is modeled via a graph where the vertices and the edges are respectively the story objects and their corresponding relations. As the story goes by the **state is modified** via applying a **delta of changes** in moments called **events**.

**Basically this is Git for storytellers.**
